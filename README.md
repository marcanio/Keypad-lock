# Keypad-lock (Encoder/ Decoder)

This project was completed on a CycloneÂ® V SX board with verilog code. It was able to store a users password and encode it using the "Tiny Encryption Algorithm". It was better known for its use in the original Xbox's. Using this algorithim I was able to encode a password to make it look like random values to a user looking at the encrypted password but then was able to decode the password in order for the user to see it again. This was built mainly in verilog but also used some block diagrams.
